## App Info

DreamSub Anime is a simple and lightweight app for watching anime online.

It is a free software, and you can use it for free.
The app is 100% written in Kotlin and 90% of UI is written on [JetPack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose?gclid=Cj0KCQiAys2MBhDOARIsAFf1D1dxCDz8AN1hkw-ahaH3hplGAcm180euHIj_YhWQmcRHYn_ojaHuaEMaAriwEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).
I tried to write the app in modular way, so that it can further increase the app's flexibility.

This app receive a data from [AniApi](https://aniapi.com) using Retrofit2 and process data using Paging2.
Since most of the anime episodes are not available, and even if some episodes are available they are not in english language and some episode links are even not working, therefore further development is stopped.
